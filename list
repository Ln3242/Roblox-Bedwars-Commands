BedWars Commands Guide
All commands in Roblox BedWars are done in the chat window of the game. This can be opened by clicking on the chat icon at the top left of the screen or pressing the “/” key on your keyboard. You must include the “/” with your command when you enter it or it will not work.

If a command has parenthesis then it is expecting you to input the parameter listed. For example, if it says “(player)” you would add the player’s display name or username in place: /tp example_player. X represents a number, you need to replace it with the amount you would like.

Credit to this command list posted by DV Plays for some help with the commands. Use CTRL + F on your keyboard with the name of the command you are looking for to find them more easily!
